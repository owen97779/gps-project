# GPS Project
## Introduction
The aim of the project is to design an open-source IoT-enabled GPS that can be used to provide coordinates at the behest of the user. The success of the device can be quantified by these factors:

### Hardware
- [ ] Open-source design
- [ ] Small form-factor and weight
- [ ] Durable
- [ ] Physical indicators of task completion
- [ ] ESD protection
- [ ] USB-C charging
- [ ] Wifi communication
- [ ] Cellular IoT communication
- [ ] Local storage
- [ ] Low power consumption
- [ ] Passing EMC tests
- [ ] Widely available and low cost components

### Software
- [ ] Open-source software
- [ ] OTA firmware updates
- [ ] Customisable GPS tracking intervals
- [ ] MQTT protocol adoption
- [ ] API integration

## Design
Multiple prototypes are being developed, each prototype with the aim of improving each design based on the limitations of the current in achieving the goals outlined above. The process can be viewed on [my blog](https://owen97779.github.io/GPS.html).

## Repository Branches
There are multiple branches working on different aspects of the project. Finalised builds will be merged onto the main branch.
